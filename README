I have quite a decent chunk of code from my own frameworks that overlap some of node's APIs, 
and as I move through them and submit patches for inclusion in node core, this will remain
my dumping ground for things that get rejected for whatever reason.

I'll try to give clear usage examples under each module's respective folders via READMEs.

I'll also explain a bit of the reasoning given as to why things don't get included into core.
